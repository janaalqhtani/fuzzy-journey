# Enterprise Threat Detection & NCA-ECC Compliance Lab
**Target Role:** Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst / Security Engineer

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment. I have engineered a resilient monitoring system using **Wazuh (SIEM)** and **Sysmon** to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) and common attack vectors. 

The lab is specifically designed to align with the **National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC)**, simulating the security posture required for a major Saudi industrial entity 
## 🛠️ Core Competencies & Tools
* **SIEM:** Wazuh (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard)
* **Telemetry:** Windows Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity/MITRE Config)
* **Networking:** VirtualBox Bridged Networking, TCP/IP, Port 1514
* **Compliance:** Saudi NCA-ECC 2024 Framework
* **Security Research:** Threat Hunting, Log Analysis, Attack Simulation
## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The lab is architected to simulate a corporate DMZ and internal network segment. By utilizing a **Hub-and-Spoke** model, the Wazuh Manager acts as the central intelligence hub, receiving encrypted telemetry from distributed endpoints.

## 🛡️ Attack Simulation & Detection Evidence

To verify the effectiveness of the detection engine, I performed a series of controlled attack simulations. These simulations mimic real-world techniques used by adversaries to gain persistence and steal credentials.

### **Test Case 1: Brute Force Attack (Authentication Failure)**

#### **Incident Overview**
* **Attack Technique:** Brute Force / Credential Guessing
* **Target Asset:** `Endpoint-01` (Windows 10 Enterprise)
* **Detection Goal:** Identify high-frequency authentication failures and map process lineage
* **NCA-ECC Alignment:** **ECC-3-1** (Incident Management)

#### **Technical Analysis & Evidence**

**Phase 1: Inbound Telemetry (Sysmon Process Tree)**
The attack was initiated via a PowerShell script that leveraged a loop to spawn multiple `net.exe` processes. This "Living off the Land" (LotL) technique was captured using **Sysmon Event ID 1**, providing deep visibility into the parent-child relationship of the malicious activity.

> ![Process Tree Analysis](images/attack-source-powershell.png)
> *Figure 1: Telemetry confirms `powershell.exe` as the parent of `net.exe` with the specific command line used for the attack.*

**Phase 2: SIEM Alerting (Wazuh Dashboard)**
The **Wazuh Manager** successfully correlated the rapid succession of failed attempts. As seen in the telemetry, the pattern of multiple failures occurring in under 5 seconds distinguishes this as an automated script rather than a human error, triggering a priority alert.

**Phase 3: Forensic Deep Dive**
By analyzing the specific alert details, we can isolate the targeted account and the specific error codes generated by the Windows Security Log (Event ID 4625).

#### **Forensic Conclusion**
| Field | Value | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parent Image** | `powershell.exe` | Indicates script-based execution |
| **Target User** | `SABIC_Hacker_Trial` | Confirms unauthorized account targeting |
| **Alert Level** | 5 | Triggers initial SOC triage |

### **🛡️ Mitigation Strategy: Automated Active Response**

To move from passive monitoring to proactive defense, the following mitigation strategy was implemented to align with **NCA-ECC-3-1** (Incident Management).

* **The Solution:** Enabled **Wazuh Active Response** to provide real-time protection.
* **The Action:** The system is configured to automatically block the source IP address at the firewall level once an attack pattern is confirmed.
* **Trigger Threshold:** The block is activated after **5 failed login attempts within 60 seconds**, significantly reducing the window for a successful brute force.
* **Business Value:** This automation reduces the **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** and ensures critical assets remain available by preventing resource exhaustion.
